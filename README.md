# Strata common crates

This repo contains crates that are shared between the different Strata repos.

Initially, this will contain crates relevant for the core protocol, but in the
future it may include crates for APIs and messaging around the sides of the core
system.  Most crates here for now will be directly implementing upstream spec
docs.

More will be here in the future.
